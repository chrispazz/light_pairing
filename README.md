# Light Pairing
This is custom component of Home Assistant.

THIS INTEGRATION HAS BEEN FULLY WRITTEN BY OPENAI WITH MY INSTRUCTIONS so I can't guarantee changes or evolutions.

Main purpose of this integration is to create new Virtual Lights based on a pair if a phisical switch and a smart light bulb.

Configuration allows to specify if on switch_off the phisical swith has to be switched off or only the smart bulb.
Also you can define the switch on light brightness you want when phisical switch is operated.

## Installation
1. Install via registering as a custom repository of HACS or by copying `light_pariring` folder into `<config directory>/custom_components`
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to Settings > Devices & Services.
4. In the bottom right corner, select the Add Integration button.
5. Select Light Pairing and follow the instructions on screen
